                Welcome to my blog on Python Fundamentals! Whether you are a beginner looking to learn programming or an 
                experienced developer brushing up on your skills, this post will cover the essential concepts that form the 
                foundation of Python programming.

                What is Python?
            </div>
            <div class="blogPage_details">
                Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It is widely 
                used in various fields, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.

                Key Features of Python
            </div>
            <div class="blogPage_details">
                <br>
                <li>Easy to Learn and Use: Python has a clean and straightforward syntax that is easy to understand for beginners.</li><br>
                <li>Versatile: Python can be used for a wide range of applications, from scripting and automation to web applications and data analysis.</li><br>
                <li>Extensive Libraries: Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that extend its capabilities, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Django.</li>

            <div class="blogPage_details_subtitles">
                Basic syntaxs
            </div>
            <div class="blogPage_details">
                In Python, the foundation of programming lies in its syntax, which is both intuitive and powerful. For instance, 
                you can easily create variables to store data, such as name = "Alice" or age = 30, where name holds a string and
                age an integer. Python supports various data types, including integers, floats, strings, lists, and dictionaries, 
                allowing you to manage different kinds of information seamlessly. Control structures like if, for, and while are 
                essential for directing the flow of your program. For example, using an if statement, you can check a condition s
                uch as if age >= 18: to determine whether a person is an adult, making your code interactive and responsive. 
                Furthermore, Python encourages the use of functions to encapsulate reusable code. You might define a function 
                like def greet(name): to generate personalized greetings, which can be invoked later with print(greet("Alice")). 
                This combination of variables, data types, control structures, and functions forms the building blocks of 
                programming in Python, enabling you to write clear and efficient code.

                Learning Python fundamentals is a great way to start your programming journey. With its simplicity and versatility, 
                Python is an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. I encourage you to explore and experiment 
                with Python through projects and exercises.

            </div>
            <div class="blogPage_details_subtitles">
                Introduction
            </div>
            <div class="blogPage_details">
                GitHub is a powerful platform that has become an essential tool for programmers and developers around the world. 
                It provides a collaborative environment where developers can work on projects, manage code, and share their work with others. 
                In this post, we will explore the key features of GitHub and how it can enhance your programming workflow.
            </div>
            <div class="blogPage_details_subtitles">
                Why is GitHub
            </div>
            <div class="blogPage_details">
                GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git, a version control system, to help developers manage and track changes 
                to their code. It allows multiple users to collaborate on projects, making it easier to contribute to open-source software, 
                share code, and maintain version history.
            </div>
            <div class="blogPage_details_subtitles">Key Features of GitHub</div>
            <div class="blogPage_details">
                <br>
                <li>Version Control: GitHub enables developers to keep track of changes in their code, allowing them to revert to previous 
                    versions if needed. This is crucial for debugging and maintaining code quality.</li><br>
                <li>Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously. GitHub's branching 
                    feature allows developers to create separate lines of development, making it easy to implement new features without affecting the main codebase.</li><br>
                <li>Open Source Projects: GitHub hosts millions of open-source projects, allowing developers to 
                    contribute to existing projects or start their own. This fosters a sense of community and encourages knowledge sharing.</li><br>
                <li>Issue Tracking: GitHub provides tools for tracking issues, bugs, and feature requests. 
                    This helps teams prioritize work and keep projects organized.</li><br>
                <li>Documentation and Wikis: GitHub allows you to create documentation and wikis for your 
                    projects, making it easier for other developers to understand and contribute to your work.</li>
            </div>

                <li>Create a Repository: A repository (or "repo") is where your project files are stored. You can create a 
                    new repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine using the command line:
                    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git</code></pre>
                </li><br>
                <li>Commit Changes: After making changes to your code, you can commit those changes to your local repository:
                    <pre><code>git add .</code></pre>
                    <pre><code>git commit -m "Your commit message"</code></pre>
                </li><br>
                <li>Push Changes: Finally, push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub:
                    <pre><code>git push origin main</code></pre>
